All tasks are taken from [Daily Coding Problem Solutions](https://github.com/ruppysuppy/Daily-Coding-Problem-Solutions).
Each problem has at least one test.

Problem 21: Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping),
find the minimum number of rooms required.

Problem 37: The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set,
generates its power set.

Problem 71: Using a function rand7() that returns an integer from 1 to 7 (inclusive) with uniform probability,
implement a function rand5() that returns an integer from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

Problem 75: Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
The subsequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous.

Problem 118: Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.

Problem 165: Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element in the new array
is the number of smaller elements to the right of that element in the original input array.

Problem 189: Given an array of elements, return the length of the longest subarray where all its elements are distinct.

Problem 221: Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of 7, or the sum of unique powers of 7.
The first few sevenish numbers are 1, 7, 8, 49, and so on.
Create an algorithm to find the nth sevenish number.

Problem 235: Given an array of numbers of length N,
find both the minimum and maximum using less than 2 * (N - 2) comparisons.

Problem 285: You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street,
from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns
how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.
